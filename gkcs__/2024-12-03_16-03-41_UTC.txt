New year. Same message.

From 2023:

My friend faced this problem a few years ago.

She was severely underpaid in her organization (works about 80 hours a week and is paid 40% less than average for the role).

So she started interviewing with companies.

And before every offer, the recruiter asked for her previous payslips.

Then she was offered (at most) a 30% hike. With the argument that this is much higher than what she currently gets.

But her current salary was much lower than market rate, and a 30% hike wasn't enough.

It put her in a tough spot. If she tried to switch twice (30% twice is roughly 70% overall), she would need to work at the first company for at least a year.

Otherwise, recruiters worry about "not spending enough time" at the previous company.

The problem seems unique to India. This year, let's make a promise?

If you are a candidate, being asked to send previous payslips, push back.
If you are a recruiter being asked to get previous payslips, please push back.

Keep the offer negotiations based on skills, not previous salaries.

Don't let these practices see the light of the new year.
